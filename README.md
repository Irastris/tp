PC port of the Twilight Princess decomp, extremely WIP. As in, not even remotely Twilight Princess yet.

This is an educational project, I have very little clue what I'm doing and am learning as I go.

Credits to Metaforce (Metroid Prime PC port), Mario Party 4 PC port, and Super Monkey Ball PC port, which I am referencing and at times using code from when applicable.
